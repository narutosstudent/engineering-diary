# What could have been better?

I think looking back at the week, I wish I had been more productive. Some bugs and stuff take longer to implement and are annoying, but I've a feeling without music I can work more focused, maybe I should continue to do so.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

I think the main part is the feature flag sample with config cat.

# What did you learn?

Looking back I probably learned various stuff indirectly. Setting the context in the remix handler, intercepting cypress requests, that async await is more than syntactic sugar, and maybe some more stuff.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feeling okay, I think it could've been better, and I could've been more productive.

I think I should start working out during daytime instead, so like around 1 to 2 a clock, and nap between 12.30 and 1.

I think if I get solid 7h of sleep, that routine should work quite nicely for me.
