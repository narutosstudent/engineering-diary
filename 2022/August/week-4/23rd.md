# What could have been better?

I could've done some performance testing, both lighthouse and with React profiler.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Shared knowledge in slack, proposed ideas to how we could handle shared components between nested routes, catched cases where we had forgotten to write tests, and also implemented a test case that was asked whether it had been implemented or not.

# What did you learn?

We already had a cypress command to set the share source location.

You can configure the remix.config.js to your own needs for your routes folder.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feels great, today was a day here I shared knowledge, proposed ideas, and also improved existing code.
