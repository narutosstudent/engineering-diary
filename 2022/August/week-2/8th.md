# What could have been better?

-

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Continued sharing knowledge on testing.

I also tested around with Lighthouse and brought up points to improve the performance of our app and its current accessible state.

# What did you learn?

I guess working more with the Dev Tools, using the Performance Insights.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Felt fantastic, I went the extra mile thinking outside the box how our app can improve, feeling great.
