# What could have been better?

Not sure, perhaps asked for help sooner, or let people know what exactly I'm debugging, then maybe someone could've given me inputs, feedback or guidelines sooner.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

I wouldn't say it was outstanding, but it did require patience debugging the E2E Tests for so long and dealing with the Firebase Emulator, it was tricky indeed narrowing down where the problem was.

After fixing the data of the initialized provider to be as the one in dev mode, everything got fixed.

# What did you learn?

Debugging the E2E Tests, running firebase emulator and cypress at the same time.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feeling great, nothing too extraordinary.
