# What could have been better?

Could've been more patient when writing the test and not diverted from the scroll solution of cypress. Could've analyzed the bundle size better and if the win is really worth it before proposing a change in the dependencies.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Wrote a lot of Cypress tests and also solved how to scroll within the MUI Data grid. Implemented accessibility improvements and a fix to avoid large layout shift (perf/UX improvement).

# What did you learn?

Cypress scroll in a container. Fix avoid layout shifts.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feeling fantastic, was an awesome day.
