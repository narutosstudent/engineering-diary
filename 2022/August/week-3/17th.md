# What could have been better?

-

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Kept hammering out tests and improving existing ones, as well as adding accessibility improvements. I also helped a lot with recruiting and getting Andy in touch with talented engineers. I posted a tweet and job posting in the remix discord server, that we're hiring experienced engineers.

# What did you learn?

Debugging deeper with cypress and trying to figure out why it wasn't properly logging out the user.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feels really awesome, today was an outstanding day.
