# What could have been better?

Honestly the only thing would've been being on time to the coaching, otherwise today went fantastic.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Added more tests and improved existing test setup.

I'm gonna continue improving some more tests tomorrow, in particular those in need of random content.

# What did you learn?

Learned more of our cypress setup as well as setting up multiple users and logging in & out with them.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feels more than fantastic.
