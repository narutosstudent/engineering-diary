# What could have been better?

The day actually went fantastic, from beginning to end, pushed hard and performed well.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

I added docs for debugging cypress tests locally, and opened three new PRs with new tests and improving the existing tests + making the code more accessible.

# What did you learn?

I learned how to run the cypress tests repeatedly and also that you can just add any util functions to the cypress tests without calling await, it worked nicely.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feels more than fantastic.
