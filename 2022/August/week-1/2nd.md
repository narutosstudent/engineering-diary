I'm late again, doing it the day after early morning, though instead I should do this in the evening after work. Today I'm gonna define 5 points I want to answer or contemplate about, which I will continue to do, this way it is easy to keep a good format for this engineering diary.

# What could have been better?

I could've started my focused work earlier, and make sure to timebox the time I'm talking to the others about PRs or doing research for improving our DX speed.

I could've thought of a simpler solution than straight up adding a new dependency and using MSW for our API tests, even though MSW is really great, we still are a start up and need to focus on things being simple than perfect.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

I think it was great for me to bring up ideas on how we can improve our PR process, including the article about Ship, Show and Ask, and the podcast episode from Netlify related to pair programming. I also started a Miro board for improving our DX.

# What did you learn?

Well, working with the MUI snackbar was a total pain, but in the end I got it all to work by using the action prop of the Alert within the Snackbar, and not the Snackbar itself, things worked out in the end I guess. I do believe if I had pair coded with someone perhaps it would've been done quicker.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

I'm quite happy with how the work day went, feels great that we get a few weeks to focus on improving existing code and the DX, making sure to improve the development speed, which I think is SUPER important for us right now since we have our first customers, and there is gonna be LOADS of work to do.
