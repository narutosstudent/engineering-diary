A bit late on this one again...

# What could have been better?

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Shared knowledge on best practices when it comes to testing library and helped co-worker out with writing good tests.

# What did you learn?

Knew this before but got reminded of that we can throw within our functions/methods of the firebase-lib, whenever we want the user of the function to be able to handle error cases.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Felt ordinary, nothing too special aside from the engineering meeting. I think instead of pushing for pair programming as a whole, I'll start with one co worker and coordinate more with them, as they say, if you want to influence the people around you, you gotta set an example yourself.
