# What could have been better?

I could've better prepared for the engineering meeting, even just as little as 20 minutes should be enough to not be overwhelmed by all the new information.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Advocated for collective ownership and implemented changes and merged co-worker's PR. Pushing forward for an atmosphere of trust and great teamwork.

# What did you learn?

Learned how to use useOutletContext by Remix and was a learningful experience trying to decouple something into two different nested routes, but also share the same data they get from the parent, and only fetch what is different within the nested routes.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Was a fantastic day! :D
