# What could have been better?

I should've revised my notes related to solving problems, and better pinned down what is going with the cypress tests. I should've moved right away to using the command fail on console errors and not doing it manually since that is just a waste of time anyways if i plan on moving to it later regardless. I wish I had taken a step back, and took notes of everything I tried as in my notes of solving problems, it would've made things so much better.

# Did you do anything outstanding?

Not sure... checking existing PRs and sort of pinning down slowly where the problem is, but today could've been much better, rough day.

# What did you learn?

A lot...

just disappointed i repeated mistakes i should not have done.

# Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

Feels ok, great lesson learned via hands on experience, i guess im fine.
