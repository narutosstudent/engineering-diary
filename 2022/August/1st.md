I'm writing this a day late, as I was really deep into work yesterday evening. It was fun and it also went well, I'm really enjoying how I'm in a much faster pace being able to deliver stories. Now I also make sure to not just follow the design and requirements strictly, but instead look if there are other more simpler solutions. We got a lot of things done yesterday, I was asking Krysz what he thought of just disabling the rows for the users if the content size is too big, he also agreed to implement it since th solution was much easier and just a few lines of code, we implmented it with a tool tip.

I started reading the book the Fundamentals of Data Engineering. I hope this book allows me to gain insights to what further problems we can solve at Bobsled and also understand our users even more!

It's been really fun lately, coding from the very start till end of the day, I'm enjoying it a lot. Working here at Bobsled feels fantastic, becuase I get to be a part of building a whole company and not just coding.

I was struggling hard yesterday with the Snackbar from MUI, the action node wouldn't just show, it was unvisible all the time! I'm not sure why but I did ask them in one of their issues, was really annoying.

I also did a bit of research yesterday related to performance. I'm gonna take some weekend in August to properly learn more about the React Profiler and practically working with the Dev Tools, or I might just do it at work to be honest and try it out there.
