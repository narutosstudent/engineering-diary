# How did the week go?

It went amazing. I met my key expectations. Improved our existing codebase by introducing new lint rules that will result in consistent and more readable code.

I also found places to improve our Cypress tests, and moved the Cypress tests in the Remix App to a separate package. I also worked on the Terraform stack for our customers, and made sure to address comments by other co workers.

I gave feedback on the job posting for engineering managers and been researching for how we can interview our engineering managers effectively despite the limited time.
