# How did the week go?

It went amazing. I met my key expectations. Improved our existing codebase by introducing new lint rules that will result in consistent and more readable code.

I wrote an article about TypeScript and shared it with the team.

I drove discussions for improving the way we architect our Remix routes.

I brought up the discussion of handling formData and made a PR with the parseForm function.

I gave feedback to the marketing site's careers page for improvements.

I shared an article about data engineering and a podcast about product which both contains great points.

I made sure to start working on the Terraform workshop with Simone and made a lot of progress there.
