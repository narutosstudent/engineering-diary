# How did the week go?

This week was great. I pair coded with Johannes on azure stuff, revoking the service principals, ties back to my goal of learning from the principal engineers. Simone and I made great progress and finished the file picker doing TDD, it was awesome, we could collaborate and when we disagreed we still had respectful conversations, i really enjoyed it.

I started refactoring save delivery. It is a wrong abstraction, one with multiple responsibilities/knowledge. It was a mess and pain to work in, but I'm glad I began and I also asked for feedback to understand the context better.

Lucas and I talked about potential styling solutions, we both really liked SASS and agreed on it. Being closed to the platform while still getting the power of nesting and some other stuff.

I gave tips in the slack channel on writing good e2e tests and accessible html.

Last week was the first week of the study group, increasing our domain knowledge, I'm glad I started it and looking forward to where it is going.

Note: The week before I pair coded with Krysz on Metrics stuff. It went great, not just did I learn from him but also asked if there is anything we should do in the Remix app ASAP. He mentioned I could catch responses at the top of the remix app, ive yet still to write the story and implement it for 2xx, 4xx and 5xx responses.
