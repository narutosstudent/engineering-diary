# How did the week go?

It went amazing. I met my key expectations. I encouraged Lucas to share Around and did an initial security check. Around is a software that makes the collaboration when pair/mob coding better than zoom and slack.

I pair coded with Simone a ton and helped push things forward like refactoring saveDelivery and having a mob session on firebase functions test.

I attended a user interview where I learned about potential customer and their problems.

I wrote an article about data sharing and increased my domain knowledge.

I was a part of the values working group.
