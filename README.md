This is my engineering diary, specifically for work. There are numerous reasons to why you may want to have an engineering diary, and the benefits you get from having one.

I think we can learn a lot by jusut reflecting on how our day went, and answering a few points.

Right now the points I'm answering are:

- What could have been better?

- Did you do anything outstanding?

- What did you learn?

- Overall what are your feelings and are you happy with how the workday went?

I really like these points. The outstanding part is quite broad, it can be from a tough problem I solved to a process I proposed and documented.

I like having the last point as sort of a way to just taking any notes.
